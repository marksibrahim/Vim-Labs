With Vim, you can format code to your liking efficiently. 
<br>
Say you want to turn a variable name uppercase,
</p>
<blockquote class="blue-grey-text">
    try <span class="red-text">~</span> to turn anything you select to uppercase
<br>
</blockquote>
<p class="left-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">
Say you want to align the indentation of several lines,
</p>
<blockquote class="blue-grey-text">
    visually select lines using
    <span class="chip">V</span>
    then
    <span class="chip"><<</span>
</blockquote>
<p class="left-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">
    To indent further, repeat using
<span class="chip">.</span>
</p>
                <blockquote class="blue-grey-text">
    Can you align the names starting at line 20?
            </blockquote>
    <br>
                <p class="left-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">
    To go backwards use
    <span class="chip">>></span>

Vim can remember what you copied long ago, even if you copy over it. Let's introduce you to Vim's intelligent clipboard:
</p>
<blockquote class="blue-grey-text">
    Let's delete line 5. Remember
<span class="chip">dd</span>?
    <br>
    Let's also delete Lilly on line 23

<p class="left-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">
    Oops, what if we now realize we need that first sentence?
    It turns out everything you delete or copy is stored in Vim's intelligent clipboard.
</p>
<blockquote class="blue-grey-text">
<span class="chip">:reg</span> will bring up everything in the clipboard.
    <br>
    <span class="chip">"1</span>+<span class="chip">p</span> to paste the original text

Let's greet Frank, Buddy, and the rest of the gang using Vim's automation powers.
Macros allow you to record and replay any actions:
</p>
<blockquote class="blue-grey-text">
    1. Go to line 23 ("Frank")
    <br>
    2. Start recording by typing 
<span class="chip">qa</span>
    <br>
&emsp;
    (this tells vim to record in register 'a')
    <br>
    3. Type 
    <span class="chip">I</span> 
    to add a "hey" at the begining
    <br>
    4. Exit Insert mode then type 
    <span class="chip">A</span> 
    to add an '!' at the end 
    <br>
&emsp;
    (you love Frank)
    <br>
    5. Finally type 
<span class="chip">q</span> to stop recording
</blockquote>
<p class="left-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">
You just recorded your first macro. 
Go down a line to "Buddy" and replay those steps by typing
<span class="chip">@a</span>
<br>
<br>
Isn't that amazing? Imagine all the ways you can use macros.
</p>
            </div>
            <!--- STEP 3 END -->

            <!--- STEP 4 -->
<div id="step4">
<p class="left-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">
Let's greet our gang of dogs even more efficiently. 
<br>
First, clear the existing greetings.
<br>
Now, let's record our greeting for Frank again, but let's also include 
a last step 'j' to go down to the next line:
</p>
<blockquote class="blue-grey-text">
    1. 
<span class="chip">qa</span> to record Frank's greeting
    <br>
    2. add "hey" at the begining and "!" at the end
    <br>
    3. before stopping go down to the next line 'j'
    <br>
    4. stop recording by typing 
<span class="chip">q</span>
</blockquote>
<p class="left-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">
Now our cursor should be on the line with "Buddy".
<br>
Let's replay the macro 4 times by typing
<span class="chip">4@a</span>
<br>
We greeted all the dogs at once! 
<br>
Macros are your best automation friend. Unleash their powers!
