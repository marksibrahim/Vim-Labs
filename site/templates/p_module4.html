Visual mode highlights text before you operate on it. It's a great way to make sure you're deleting or copying the right thing. 
<br>
<br>
<span class="chip">v</span> starts Visual Mode. Now, apply any motion to select text.
<br>
</p>

<blockquote class="blue-grey-text">
Try
<span class="chip">v + }</span> to grab a paragraph.
</blockquote>

<p class="left-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">
<span class="chip">w</span> is useful for grabbing a word as is 
selecting up to a character <span class="chip">f + character</span>
<br>
<br>
For more complex selections, activate Visual Block Mode: 
<br>
<span class="chip">V</span>
+ any motion. You can use j, k, l to highlight blocks of text. 
<br>
So what? You can, for example, insert text at the begining of many lines all at once! 
</p>
<blockquote class="blue-grey-text">
try selecting the first character on lines 6-9: 
<br>
<span class="chip">V + j</span>
then 
<span class="chip">I</span>
and ')'. Once you escape to Normal mode, text will appear on all lines!

Visual selection is useful for copying. 
</p>
<blockquote class="blue-grey-text">
Try visually selecting a paragraph: 
<span class="chip">v + }</span>
then copy (yank) using: 
<span class="chip">y</span>.
</blockquote>

<p class="left-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">
<span class="chip">p</span> pastes the selection. (
<span class="chip">P</span> pastes above)
<br>
You can also quickly copy lines using 
<span class="chip">yy</span>
<br>
You can apply a similar trick to delete a line: 
<span class="chip">dd</span>
<br>

Once you delete a piece of text, it's automatically added to your clipboard. So after deleting a word or paragraph you can paste it elsewhere by simply typing 
<span class="chip">p</span>!
<br>
</p>
<blockquote class="blue-grey-text">
Try copying then pasting a word:
<span class="chip">yaw</span>
then 
<span class="chip">p</span>.

            <!--- STEP 3 -->
<div id="step3">
<p class="left-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">
With actions operating on objects, comes the power to repeat.
Type a number before an action to repeat it.
</p>
<blockquote class="blue-grey-text">
Try copying a sentence. Remember how?
(<span class="chip">yy</span>)
<br>
Next paste 3 times
<span class="chip">3p</span>.
</blockquote>

<p class="left-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">
Try applying the same idea to a motion. 
<br>
Try moving down 10 lines. Instead of pressing jjjjjj (10 times), just type 
<span class="chip">10j</span>
<br>
Repitition can be applied everywhere, even with undo. Make two changes. To undo both try
<span class="chip">2u</span>

<p class="left-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">
How do you search for a word in Vim? It's easy! 
<br>
type
<span class="chip">\</span>
to activate search. Type any word to search.
<br>
&emsp;
<span class="chip">n</span> navigates to the next occurence
<br>
&emsp;
<span class="chip">N</span> to the previous
<br>

Vim search shines, because it accepts search patterns by default&mdash;not just words. 
<br>
</p>
<blockquote class="blue-grey-text">
Let's search for all words begining with 'vi':
<span class="chip">\vi.</span>
</blockquote>

<p class="left-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">
<span class="chip">.</span>
in a search pattern matches any character
<br>
Find this or that using 
<span class="chip">\this\|that</span>
<br>
The "\" above is an escape character which takes away any meaning a special character carries.
<br>
<br>
If you want to learn more about regex pattern search see here.
<br>
Another neat trick is 
<br>
<span class="chip">*</span> searches the word under the cursor automatically!
